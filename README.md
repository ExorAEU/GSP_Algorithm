**GSP Algorithm - Basic Description, Common Syntax and Case Study**
===============

This is a simple example of GSP Algorithm Implementation, factoring in Minimum Item Support Values and Support Difference Constraint. The script is built by employing emulating several sources, mainly praveenchandroo which can be found at [his Github address.](https://github.com/praveenchandroo)

The script utilizes 2 input files, given here as *data.txt* and *para.txt*, which define the Dataset and the MIS and SDC values respectively. The workflow of the script is more or less identical to the one described below.

## Definitions

MIS
: A threshold for the minimum occurrence of an item throughout the patterns, starting from singletons and moving up the hierarchy.

SDC
: A constraint which defines the permissible deviation for items from their MIS in percentage.
